        <h4>GoLang File Server</h4>
        <p>A GoLang server implements a multi-client / multi-threaded file system server with transactional semantics.</p>

        <h4 id="inspr">The Inspiration and Problem</h4>
        <p>I wanted to learn how to use GoLang and wanted to build a multi-client / multi-threaded
            file system server with
            transactional semantics.
            <br><br>
            Since GoLang is a fantastic serverside language that essentially handles multi-threading by itself, I
            really wanted to learn how to use it and leverage its amazing capabilities!
            <br> <br>
            <b>This server supports the following commands:</b>
            <ul>
                <li> READ - the client reads the file from the server. In that case, the transaction ID can be set to
                    any number, as it will not be interpreted by the server: reads are not part of any transaction. The
                    content-length field will contain the length of the file name. The data field will contain the file
                    name itself. For this assignment you should assume that file names contain no spaces.
                </li>

                <li> NEW_TXN - the client asks the server to begin a new transaction
                </li>

                <li> WRITE - the client asks the server to write data as part of an existing transaction
                </li>

                <li> COMMIT - the client asks the server to commit the transaction. In this case, the message sequence
                    number field includes the total number of writes that were sent by the client as part of this
                    transaction.</li>

                <li> ABORT - the client asks the server to abort the transaction
                </li>

                <li>ACK - the server acknowledges the committed transaction to the client or indicates a successful
                    response to the client's NEW_TXN request.</li>

                <li>ASK_RESEND - the server asks the client to resend a message for the given transaction whose
                    sequence number is specified in the "message sequence number" field </li>

                <li>ERROR - the server reports an error to the client. The error code and the ID of the transaction
                    that
                    generated the error must be included in the appropriate fields in the message</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>The System and Technologies</h4>
        <p>The application is built in GoLang</p>

        <h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
        <p>Ensuring that the server would handle omission, byzantine and failstop failures on the client and failstop
            failures on the server.</p>
