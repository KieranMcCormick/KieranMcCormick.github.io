<h1> Assignment #4 - Distributed File system with Transactional Semantics </h1><p> (Thanks to Prof. Sasha Fedorova for providing this assignment) </p><p>
      <b><font color="ff0000">Full assignment due by 11:59pm Mar 30th.</font></b>
    </p><table width="900">
  <tbody><tr>
    
    
    
</tr><tr><td>
  <p><font size="2">Your goal is to implement a distributed file system with
        transactional semantics. A transaction is a sequence of file operations
        that follow the properties of (A)tomicity, (C)consistency, (I)solation
        and (D)urability (ACID). That is, each sequence of file operations must
        appear atomic, leave the file system consistent, work in face of concurrency
        and survive server or client failures. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The file system supports both reads and writes, but semantics of read are quite simple: files
      are always read in their entirety. There are certain semantic rules that
        govern correct write operations submitted the file server, which we describe below.
        In addition, your system should implement the specified message format
        for the wire protocol, so that we can test your system using our own client.
        During the course of the assignment you will implement the file server
        and a client that you will use to test your server. You will submit to
        us the code for the file server; we will test it using our own client.
        The assignment can be done in any programming language, as long as your
        server is designed to accept messages over a TCP connection. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Your system will be required to handle omission, byzantine
        and failstop failures on the client and failstop failures on the server.
        The server must be stateful: it must remember about the operations it
        was doing before it crashed, as described by the rules below.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We now describe the rules for the system. First we describe
        how the client and server must interact and handle failures. Then we describe
        the message format for the client-server protocol. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><font size="4">Client-Server Interaction</font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We describe several modes of interactions between the
        client and the server, such interaction in the common-case (no failures)
        and interaction in face of failures. </font></p>
      <font size="2">
      <p><b>Common case interaction (no failures, transaction is committed)</b>
      </p>
      </font> <ul>
      <li><span class="cmpt401assign"><font size="2">Reads are quite simple.
      The client sends the name of the file to the server, and the server returns the file in its
      entirety. The rest of the section talks about writes. </font></span></li>
      <li><span class="cmpt401assign"><font size="2">The
      client requests a new transaction ID from the server, at the
      same time specifying the file that will be written during that
      transaction</font></span></li> <li><font size="2">The server
      generates a unique transaction ID and returns it to the
      client. If the file specified by the client in the message
      requesting transaction ID does not exist, the server creates the
      file.</font></li> <li><font size="2">All subsequent
      client/server messages corresponding to a transaction will
      contain the ID of that transaction</font></li> <li><font size="2">The client sends to the server a series of write
      requests to the transaction's file. </font><font size="2">Each
      request is numbered.</font></li> <li><font size="2">The client
      asks the server to commit the transaction, that is to ensure
      that all write requests are written to the file on the server's
      disk.</font></li> <li><font size="2">The server appends all
      writes sent by the client to the file, flushes the file data to
      disk and sends an acknowledgement of the committed transaction
      to the client.</font></li> <li><font size="2">The new file must
      not be seen on the file system until the transaction
      commits. That is a read request for a file that was created as part of an uncommitted transaction must
      generate an error.</font></li>

      <li><font size="2">The server must
      acknowledge the client's message requesting a new
      transaction. This acknowledgement message will have the
      transaction ID.
      Write requests can be acknowledged
      selectively.  </font></li> </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><i> We will test the correctness of common case interaction
        by checking that after the transaction commits, the file written by the
        client has the contents written during the transaction. We will also check
        that the data written to the file as part of the transaction is not seen
        in the file until the client has committed the transaction. We will also
        check that if a new file is created as part of the transaction, the file
        is not seen on the server's local file system until the transaction commits -- that is
        we will check that your server correctly returns an error when the client requests
        to read a file that is part of an uncommitted transaction.</i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Interaction in face of aborted transactions</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">A client may decide to abort the transaction after
          sending a few write requests to the server</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">In that case the client sends an "abort"
          request to the server</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server ensures that no data that the client had
          sent as part of transaction is written to the file on the disk</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server acknowledges the client's abort message</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If a new file was created as part of that transaction,
          the server deletes the file</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If the aborted transaction was about to create a new file, that file must not be seen on the file system at any point, because the enclosing transaction aborted. That is a read request for a file that was created as part of an uncommitted transaction must
      generate an error.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><i><font size="2">We will test the correctness of your system in face
        of aborted transactions by making sure that the data from the aborted
        client transaction is never to be seen in the file and the file that was
        created as part of the transaction is not in the file system if the transaction
        was aborted.</font></i></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Interaction in face of client omission failures</font></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">A client may lose some of the messages sent as part
          of a transaction</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server must not commit a transaction unless it
          has received all write requests that were a part of this transaction</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Therefore, the transaction commit request sent by the
          client includes the total number of messages that were sent by the client
          as part of that transaction</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server must keep track of all messages received
          from the client as part of each transaction</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If the server realizes that it has not received all
          of the messages that the client claims to have sent, it must ask the
          client to retransmit the missing messages</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">When asking for retransmission the server needs to
          tell the client the sequence number of the missing message (the server
          should be able to figure this out if it has kept track of message sequence
          numbers it received from the client)</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If more than one message is missing, the server may
          ask for a retransmission multiple times</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A client may lose the server's acknowledgement of the
          committed transaction. In that case, it will retransmit the message
          asking the server to commit the transaction. The server must remember
          that the transaction has been committed and re-send the acknowledgement
          to the client.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><i><font size="2">We will test the correctness of your system in face
        of client omission failures by making the client deliberately omit messages
        and making sure that a transaction with missing messages is never committed
        to the file until the server asks for and receives all the missing messages.
        </font></i></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Interaction in face of client failstop failures</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">If a client crashes before commiting the transaction,
          the transaction must never be committed</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server decides how long to keep track of unfinished
          transactions by setting a timeout</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><i>We will test the correctness of your system by making
        sure that the data from transactions that are not committed never appears
        in the file. This failure is similar to the case when the client aborts
        a transaction.</i></font></p>
      <p><b><font size="2">Interaction in face of Byzantine failures on the client</font></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Your server will be required to handle incorrect behavior
          by the client; that is when the client sends messages that do not follow
          the rules of the system</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">For example, the client might send a message with a
          transaction ID that it never received from the server; the server must
          never commit a transaction with a fake ID.</font></li>
       <font size="2">the
          server must continue operating correctly if this happens. </font>
        <li><font size="2">If the sever detects incorrect operation, it should
          return error message to the client, describing the problem as specifically
          as possible.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><i><font size="2">We will test the correctness of your server in face
        of Byzantine client failures by generating messages with fake transaction
        IDs on the client and making sure that those transactions are never committed.
        We will also have the client generate incorrect messages and check that
        the server responds to the client with an appropriate error code. </font></i></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Interaction in face of concurrency</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Multiple clients may be executing transactions against
          the same file</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server must ensure that those transactions are
          isolated, that is, it must create the illusion that the clients' transactions
          committed sequentially, even if the clients executed them concurrently</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If two clients commit their transactions on the same
          file simultaneously, it is up to the server to decide whose data gets
          committed to the file first. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><i>We will test the correctness of your server in face
        of concurrency by having many concurrent clients executing transactions
        against the same file and making sure that the messages written to the
        file by concurrent transactions appear in the file as they would had the
        transactions occurred sequentially.</i></font></p>
      <p><i><font size="2">We will also enforce certain <b>concurrency requirements
        on your server.</b> Your server must process requests from multiple clients
        concurrently. We will test this by timing your server on a multiprocessor
        system. We expect that N concurrent transactions executed by N clients
        take measurably less time to complete than the same N transactions performed
        sequentially.</font></i></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Interaction in case of failstop server failures</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">If the server crashes <i><b>before</b></i> the client
          has asked it to commit the transaction, it must be able to continue
          processing the transaction after it reboots. The server must be able
	  to continue from the point where it last sent an acknowledgement to the client.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If the server crashes <i><b>after</b></i> committing
          the transaction but before sending the acknowledgement of that fact
          to the client, it must remember that transaction had been committed.
          Once the server reboots it should be able to re-send the acknowledgement
          to the client if the client retransmits the request to commit that transaction</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If the server crashes <b><i>while</i></b> the transaction
          is being committed to the disk, it must ensure that the file is left
          in the consistent state after it reboots; that is, upon reboot it must
          ensure that no data from partially committed transactions is in the
          file. If there is such data, the server must fix the file.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The server must remember about all transactions committed
          before the crash, in case a client retransmits a transaction commit
          request after the server has crashed and rebooted.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">If the server has acknowledged a committed transaction
          to the client, the transaction data must be in the file as soon as the
          client receives the acknowledgement, no matter what happens with the
          server. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><i>We will</i> <i>test the correctness of your system
        in face of failstop server failures by killing your server while it is
        running, then manually restarting it, and making sure that it continues correct operation and cleans
        up the file system after the restart.  </i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Wire Protocol</b></font></p>

        interpreted by the server: reads are not part of any transaction. The content-length field
        will contain the length of the file name. The data field will contain the file name itself.
        For this assignment you should assume that file names contain no spaces. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Implementation Rules and Tips</b></font></p>
      <p><b><font size="2"><i>Starting your server </i></font></b><font size="2">Your
        server must accept three command line arguments: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">the IP address on which it will listen for client connections - we provide this in case the host where your server is running has multiple network interface cards and so it can listen on several different IP addresses.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">the port</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">the directory where it will keep the files created
          by the clients</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><i><b>The file system</b> </i>Your server will store files
        created and written by client transactions in the directory specified
        on startup as a command line argument. When the server starts up, that
        directory may already contain some files (we could put some files there
        for testing). You must ensure that the files in that directory are not
        deleted after the server exits. We will use the contents in those files
        to check the correctness of your system. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Since your server is statefull, it probably needs to keep
        a log or records helping it to remember its state. Make sure that those
        housekeeping logs are hidden from view on the server's file system (recall
        how Unix implements hidden files). Those files must be deleted every time
        the server exits gracefully. (If the server exits gracefully it is okay
        for it to forget about any transactions executed in the past.)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b><i>Committing file data to stable storage </i></b>When
        the client asks the server to commit a transaction, the server must ensure
        that the transaction data is flushed to disk on the local file system.
        Using the"write" system call (if you are programming in C) is
        not enough to accomplish this. If you remember from your operating systems
        course, the "write" system call puts the data into file system
        buffer cache, but does not force it to disk. Therefore, you must explicitly
        flush the data to disk when committing client transactions or when writing
        important housekeeping messages that must survive crashes. To flush thedata
        to disk, use the fsync (or fflush) system call. To tell you the truth, even fsync or fflush
        will not guarantee that the data is forced to disk: many operating systems
        return from fsync before the data is flushed to disk, while flushing the
        data on the background. To <i>really</i> flush the data to disk, you must
        call fsync (or fflush) twice. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">If you are programming in a language other than C or C++
        you must find out the equivalent to the fsync system call.</font></p>
